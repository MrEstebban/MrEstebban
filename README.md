Hi! 😁👋🏼 I'm a passionate Engineer dedicated to craft and support solutions to enhance the software experiences of organizations.
As a Software Enginner, my journey is driven by Fullstack and Cloud technologies (such as Java, SpringBoot, JavaScript, Angular, AWS, Azure, OCP Oracle DB and MSSQL Server). I like to bring positive change and impactful solutions to organizations.

✔ I have experience working with back-end (Java, Node, Microservices) but I've also worked with front-end (React, Angular). 
✔ I like to explain complex ideas and abstract concepts and translate them into a way that is easy to understand.
✔ I'm a native Spanish speaker and I speak english.
