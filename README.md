Hi! 👋🏼, I´m passionate about technology, as I see it as a way to support the day-to-day lives of people. I'm new to blockchain but very aware of the impact that can have and it's having nowadays along with AI. 👇🏼 

✔ I´m currently working with back-end (Java, Node, Microservices) but I've also worked with front-end (React, Angular). 
✔ I like to explain complex ideas and abstract concepts and translate them into a way that is easy to understand.
✔ I'm a native Spanish speaker and I speak english.
